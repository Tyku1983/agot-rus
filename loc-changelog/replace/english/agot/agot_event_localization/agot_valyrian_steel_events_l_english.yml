#Dawn
 agot_valyrian_steel.0001.t:0 "The Sword of the Morning"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0001.desc:0 "The morning's light stretches across the room all the way to where Dawn sits on her stone pedestal. The blade is as pale as the full moon forged from the heart of a fallen star covered by a dark ornate sheath; her pommel is shaped as a golden sun glows in the morning's light. This is where Dawn remains when there is no Sword of the Morning, where she rests in between bouts of fame and glory. \n\nThe granting of Dawn to a Dayne worthy of bearing her is an ancient responsibility, which now falls to me. I must select a worthy knight to live up to the standards of our ancestors. \nOver the last few years, it has come to my attention that [my_relation.GetFirstName] has grown into a talented and honourable knight — but are they worthy of becoming the next #S Sword of the Morning? #!"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0001.a:0 "I will bestow Dawn upon [my_relation.GetHerHim]."
 agot_valyrian_steel.0001.b:0 "No, I do not find [my_relation.GetHerHim] worthy."
 agot_valyrian_steel.0002.t:0 "The Sword of the Morning"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0002.desc:0  "In the dark of the night, a few hours before the dawn, my maester brings me a letter from [my_relation.GetFullNameRegnal] claiming it is urgent. I turn it over in my hands and break the purple wax button to open the letter. \n\nIt seems that [my_relation.GetFirstName] would name me to be the next #SSword of the Morning#!, if I would accept the honour. So many great Daynes have borne that fabled blade, like Lord Davos Dayne, who fought against King Yorick V Yronwood and his armies for his future wife, Princess Nymeria. These figures have brought glory to our House. Am I truly worthy to follow in their footsteps?"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0002.a:0 "I will accept the calling."
 agot_valyrian_steel.0002.b:0 "I am no Sword of the Morning."
 agot_valyrian_steel.0004.t:0 "The Sword of the Mourning"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0004.desc:0 "With the death of [dead_relative.GetFirstName], the mantle of Sword of the Morning stands empty. Once the funeral rites are over and [dead_relative.GetHerHim] is resting with the Seven who are one; Dawn will return to her pedestal to await a new bearer. There have been years of our history where the title has remained vacant as there has been no worthy candidate. \n\nHowever, another of our House may be worthy of the title Sword of the Morning and the honours and duties that come with it. [my_relative.GetFirstName] has demonstrated exceptional talent thus far and proven themselves a man of honour. Perhaps they are even worthy of becoming the next #S Sword of the Morning? #!"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0004.a:0 "I will bestow Dawn on [my_relation.GetHerHim]."
 agot_valyrian_steel.0004.b:0 "No, I do not find [my_relation.GetHerHim] worthy."

 agot_valyrian_steel.2000.t:0 "Lamenting the Lost"
 agot_valyrian_steel.2000.desc:0 "While walking the streets of [location.GetName] my mind wanders to the horrific events which took place here during the Dance of the Dragons, and both the great valor and shame of Ser [ancestor.GetFullName]. Slain during the Ride of the Seven, charging to the defense of the doomed Prince Joffery. He is the great honor of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName], and the subject of inumerable songs — yet his loss was also that of the ancestral Valyrian steel sword Lamentation.\n\nIt has not been seen for many years, but I know in my heart there must be a trail to unearth. One I can follow to the glory of reclaiming what once was ours. Afer the valiant fall of Ser Willam, there are conflicting sightings of what happened next, but most center on a single point..."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2000.a:0 "The Dragonpit..."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2000.a.tt:0 "You will investigate the disappearance of Lamentation..."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2000.b:0 "That monstrous time is better left forgotten."

 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.t:0 "The Lament of the Dragons"
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.desc:0 "I descend into the delapidated ruins of the Dragonpit, and the solemn atmosphere of what occurred here is palpable. A miasma of death, of ash and fear lingers, crystallized in the final dying moment of the great lizards and the thousands crushed beneath the crumbling monument which became a tomb.\n\nAs I wander I begin to realize the breadth of the project that lays before me. A reclamation scheme to unearth the bones of men and women and beasts who died in screaming terror. It will be difficult and arduous, and may produce nothing at all. But at the chance at finding the ruby amongst the stone, it could be priceless."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.a:0 "Searching these ruins will be costly..."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.a.tt:0 "You will hire men to clear rubble."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.b:0 "Perhaps the Grand Maester can assist my search?"
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.b.tt:0 "Maester [maester.GetFullName] might hold something in [maester.GetHerHis] archives."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.c:0 "Perhaps the smallfolk will have a trail to follow."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2001.d:0 "To run to the past is folloy. I will forge my own future."

 agot_valyrian_steel.2002.t:0 "Nothing!"
 agot_valyrian_steel.2002.desc:0 "Despite our immense efforts, we have yet to discover anything in regards to the wherabouts of Lamentation, or what occured that night in this pit. I am beginning to feel this is a hopeless endeavour."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2002.a:0 "It HAS to be here, I can feel it!"
 agot_valyrian_steel.2002.a.tt:0 "More men, more spades, keep digging!"
 agot_valyrian_steel.2002.b:0 "Perhaps the maester was the correct choice."
 agot_valyrian_steel.2002.c:0 "A riot of peasants, let us investigate peasants."

We value our history, for we are among the most venerable houses in the Kingdoms, and now I hold in my hands the physical proof of the legitimacy of our steeped history. "

 agot_valyrian_steel.2004.desc:0 "It seems Lamentation is destined to remain lost for now..."
