 #The Legacy of The Conqueror
 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.t:0 "The Legacy of The Conqueror"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.desc:0 "As I'm reading the latest missives from around the realm, I cast my mind to its origins. The conquest of the Seven Kingdoms remains one of the greatest feats achieved within one lifespan. I cannot help but ponder the impact of Aegon's Conquest on our realm. The legacy of the Targaryen dynasty is undeniable, and its foundations were drawn from that one man's actions.\n\nA part of me acknowledges the benefits that have come with Targaryen rule. Stability, centralized power, and the protection of the dragons are not things to be taken lightly. Yet, I also wonder what would have happend had Aegon not crossed from Dragonstone. Would Westeros still be divided to this day? Would a Westerosi have broken the stalemate? Could peace have been achieved without blood and fire?\n\nThe legacy of Aegon's conquest will be debated for centuries to come, but it is for me to decide what I can take away from it."

 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.a:0 "I should learn more about the High Valyrian language."

 #Reflections of Cleverness
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.t:0 "Reflections of Cleverness"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.lannister:0 "I step onto the courtyard and raise a hand to shield my face against the bright sun. The shadow of a Lannister standard flowing in the wind briefly shields my eyes, and a thought comes to my head. Lann the Clever. The mythical scion of my house.  Did he truely have the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock devoured by a pride of lions to give us our sigil? The story has many tellings. Did he manipulate the Casterlys into killing each other? Sleep with all their women in the dead of night? Drive them out with rats instead?\n\nWhile the maesters dispute all of these, saying he is nothing but a figure of myth and legend, it is a legend that I have been told I am descended from since I was a babe."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.poet:0 "I stare at the blank parchment beneath my quill. The poetry usually comes easy to me, but today I cannot make the words come. I lean back and look to the ceiling, and I wonder how the poets of the past mastered their wit.\n\nMy mind casts the picture of Lann the Clever. While the maesters dispute his existence, saying he is nothing but a figure of myth and legend, there was a man who must have mastered his wit. Though not known to be a poet, tricking the Casterlys out of one of the greatest seats in the land must be one of the most cunning feats committed in Westeros. What could I learn from such a tale?"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.bastard:0 "I bid goodbye to the minor nobles leaving and I note the squint in their eyes. Bastard. I know it's what they're thinking. The pettiest of lords they are, and yet the stain in my blood makes them regard me as their lesser. In my darker moments I may even believe them...\n\nThe disquieting thought does not leave me even as I lay abed, eyes locked to the dark ceiling. Yet in the darkness, a comforting thought arises. Bastards have achieved greatness before. Lann the Clever, the mythical founder of house Lannister, is said to have been a bastard in some tellings of the story. What petty lord can claim such a deed, legitimate blood or no? The thought calms my racing mind, and before sleep takes me, I resolve that I shall remember this on the morrow."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.bastard_legitimized:0 "I bid goodbye to the minor nobles leaving and I note the squint in their eyes. Bastard. I know it's what they're thinking. Despite it being ostensibly cleared, the circumstances of my birth still stain me, and though the pettiest of lords they are, that stain makes them regard me as their lesser. In my darker moments I may even believe the worst of it...\n\nThe disquieting thought does not leave me even as I lay abed, eyes locked to the dark ceiling. Yet in the darkness, a comforting thought arises. Bastards have achieved greatness before. Lann the Clever, the mythical founder of house Lannister, is said to have been a bastard in some tellings of the story. What petty lord can claim such a deed, legitimate blood or no?

 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.a:0 "I should learn to master my tongue as he did."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.a.a:0 "I find my way with words!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.a.b:0 "Bah! This is all too hard"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.b:0 "Such guile is inspiring!"

 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.b.b:0 "Bah! This is all too hard"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.c:0 "The thought shall inspire my poetry!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.d:0 "I can work off this stain as he did!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.e:0 "Such a tale for our founding!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.e.cynical:0 "A lie, perhaps, but a useful one."
 
 #The Last of a Dynasty
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.t:0 "The Last of a Dynasty"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.desc:0 "I hear my steps echo through the halls of my castle, dimmed only lightly by the plants dotting various windows. No sound of chidren playing. No rapturous laughter of brothers, no joyous giggling of sisters. Servants part for me as I cross the courtyard, bowing respectfully, yet their presence does not comfort me. I am alone. The last of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty.\n\nMine would not not be the first dynasty to be felled in the Reach. When Mern IX Gardener and his sons stood against the dragons in the Field of Fire during Aegon's conquest, that great line was extinguished. Is mine, too, doomed to the pages of history? I wonder now what should I take from that tale, from one dead line to a dying one?"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.a:0 "I must marry! Someone! Anyone!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.a.flavor:0 "You find the most eligible peasant to marry."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.b:0 "I'm sure [willing_courtier.GetFirstName] would be willing..."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.c.wife:0 "Come here wife!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.c.husband:0 "Come here husband!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.c.flavor:0 "You put #italic special #!effort in tonight."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.d:0 "Perhaps alone I can achieve greatness?"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.d.flavor:0 "You'll be sure to emphasise your role as the last of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty."
 
 #Lost Light, Stars Remembered
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.t:0 "Lost Light, Stars Remembered"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.desc:0 ""It's a beautiful night" [random_courtier.GetFirstName] thoughtlessly says to me, though I cannot see it. I can hear the wind of the open window, feel the cool breeze coming through, but see none of what [random_courtier.GetSheHe] speaks of. I hear the subtle sound of [random_courtier.GetHerHis] feet shifting as [random_courtier.GetSheHe] turns to me and stammers out an apology."Ah. I'm sorry my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. I....forgot." [random_courtier.GetSheHe] says, before quickly finding an excuse to leave.\n\nForgot [random_courtier.GetSheHe] says. How long has it been since I lost my sight? I cannot even look at the stars on a beautiful night...\n\nStars. Ser Symeon Star-Eyes was also blind, and yet he filled his eyes with sapphires and was a capable fighter."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.a:0 "This won't defeat me, I should train just as he did!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.b:0 "Maybe I, too, should get a pair of jeweled eyes?"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.b.flavor:0 "You will send out letters seeking skilled craftsmen."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.c:0 "That [random_courtier.GetSheHe] forgot means I must be doing well."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.c.flavor:0 "Your skill in navigating the world while blind has been noted."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0004.d:0 "I must accept that which I cannot change."
 
 agot_historical_inspiration.0005.t:0 "Forging Gemstone Eyes"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0005.desc:0 "It was not long after I sent out letters that several skilled craftsmen responded with quotes for a pair of gemstone eyes. A smile cannot help but cross my lips as I am read their designs.\n\nOne craftsman replied as requested, with a pair of sapphire eyes that will be sure to charm any I speak to. Another suggests a ruby pair instead, which would certainly look fearsome. An unorthodox suggestion was eyes of amethyst to unnerve those who would seek to do me harm. Finally, one was so bold as to suggest a pair of diamonds, dazzling all with my spleaded wealth."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0005.a:0 "The sapphire pair, like Symeon had!"
 agot_sapphire_eyes_name:0 "Sapphire Eyes"
 agot_sapphire_eyes_desc:0 "Created for the blind [ROOT.Char.GetFullName], these prosthetic sapphire eyes are an enchanting shade of blue."

 agot_ruby_eyes_desc:0 "Created for the blind [ROOT.Char.GetFullName], these prosthetic ruby eyes are an intimidating shade of red."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0005.c:0 "The amethyst pair, to unnerve my court and vassals!"
 agot_amethyst_eyes_name:0 "Amethyst Eyes"
 agot_amethyst_eyes_desc:0 "Created for the blind [ROOT.Char.GetFullName], these prosthetic amethyst eyes are inlaid with onyx, creating an unnerving purple glow."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0005.d:0 "The diamond pair, to show off my grandeur!"
 agot_diamond_eyes_name:0 "Diamond Eyes"
 agot_diamond_eyes_desc:0 "Created for the blind [ROOT.Char.GetFullName], these diamonds are carved into a pair of extravagant prosthetic eyes that cannot help but draw attention."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0005.e:0 "On second thought, this is a bit expensive."
 
 #Remembering Alicent Hightower
 agot_historical_inspiration.0006.t:0 "Remembering Alicent Hightower"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0006.desc:0 "Women have not traditionally been landholders directly in the Reach. Ruling has typically been the domain of men, and though thankfully none rule in my stead, this does sometimes lead to interesting comparisons. One such was made today, where I was told I was "As inspiring as Alicent Hightower herself".\n\nThough not ruler of land directly, Queen Alicent Hightower is likely one of the most powerful women to have ever lived in Westeros. Her legacy, however, is a complex tapestry woven with both admiration and controversy. As Queen she ably wielded more power than any woman of her age, yet it was her support of her son Aegon II that led to the destructive Dance of the Dragons which saw all her children buried and much of the realm burned.\n\nHow, then, should I regard this comparison, both as a woman and as a noble of the Reach?"

 agot_historical_inspiration.0006.desc.hightower_man:0 "Us Hightowers can trace our heritage back to the earliest days of the Reach, and many noble and honorable men can be found in that history. However, today I was reminded that one of my most notable kin was not a man, but a woman.\n\nQueen Alicent Hightower is likely one of the most powerful women to have ever lived in Westeros.

 agot_historical_inspiration.0006.a.man:0 "Alicent fought for our house, no matter the outcome. She is to be admired!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0006.a.flavor:0 "You publically state your support for Alicent's actions."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0006.b.woman:0 "By standing in the way of a woman's claim she was a traitor to her sex and sire."

 #Daemon Targaryen Reborn
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.t:0 "Daemon Targaryen Reborn"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.desc:0 "I cut down the latest lowborn cur unfortunate enough to have drawn my ire, a wry smile across my face as I watch their blood drip over my blade. "Well struck my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]! Why, it is as though you are Daemon Targaryen reborn!" one of my retainers barks.\n\nA remarkable comparison to make, that. Daemon was a man upon whom history turned. Wielder of the blade Dark Sister and rider of the dragon Caraxes, he forged his own kingdom in a war with the pirate lords of the Stepstones before playing the premier general for the Blacks in the Dance of the Dragons. Only the greatest dragon of the age was enough to put him down.\n\nWhile he was certainly skilled and we doubtless have some commonalities, do I really want to be compared to a murderer of children and one of the greatest bucherers of an age?"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.a:0 "Why am I doubting this? Of course I do!"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.b:0 "What a comparison! I'll have to be worthy of it."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.c:0 "Daemon was a fool. I shall be better than he ever was."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.c.flavor:0 "Your knights may like or dislike you for this stance."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0007.d:0 "Perhaps...perhaps I should mellow myself."
