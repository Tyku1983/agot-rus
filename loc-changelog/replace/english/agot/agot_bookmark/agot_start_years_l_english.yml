 start_year_8282_09_15_desc:0 "The Year of the False Spring has passed, and #italic winter is coming#! — and along with it, a spark that will ignite the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nRhaegar Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne, has kidnapped Lyanna Stark, daughter of the Warden of the North and betrothed to the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. When her brother Brandon Stark rode south demanding redress for her abduction, the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen denied him a fair hearing, brutally executing him alongside his father.\n\nBut when the Mad King called for the heads of the young Lords Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale instead raised his banners in rebellion. #bold As fighting spreads across Westeros like wildfire, it is up to you to decide the fate of the kingdom. For when you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.#!"
 ### 284 A.C. / The Crowned Stag ###
 start_year_8284_06_02_desc:0 "The War of the Usurper, Robert’s Rebellion — it matters not what smallfolk call it, but that #italic it is done.#!\n\nThe Targaryens are all but wiped out, their last scions scattered to the Free Cities in the form of a young man and a babe in arms. Robert I Baratheon now sits upon the Iron Throne of Westeros, but he soon realizes that being a king is not so easy as he had expected.\n\n“Honor? I’ve got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it’s honor that’s keeping the peace? #bold It’s fear! Fear and blood!#!”"
 ### 258 A.C. / War of the Ninepenny Kings ###
 start_year_8258_12_21_desc:0 "A Blackfyre pretender rises once more in the east, as a terrifying new captain-general has taken command of the Golden Company with his sights set on the Iron Throne.\n\nMaelys the Monstrous lives up to his name, and a growing alliance of pirates, outlaws, and exiles have pledged support to the would-be king. The self-fashioned Band of Nine may yet make trouble for the lords and ladies of Westeros.\n\nBut King Aegon V Targaryen has concerns at home to match the threat abroad. A champion of the smallfolk, his many reforms have upset rulers across the Seven Kingdoms, and betrothals spurned by his children have soured what little support he once held. And turmoil in the west has turned feverish, the risk of rebellion from the cunning Lord Roger Reyne held in fraught precarity.\n\n#bold Hope for the king rests in the ancient texts of Asshai, promising a rebirth of dragons to usher in a new era of prosperity. But as the inferno around him grows, it risks swallowing him whole.#!"
