 ruin_history_castamere:0 "Thousands of years of alliance and subservience between houses Lannister and Reyne would all turn to naught under the rule of Tytos Lannister, a lion who was never meant to rule. None could fault his vassals for taking advantage of his weaknesses, unwillingness to call up loans, a kind heart unwilling to see slights. None benefitted more than Roger Reyne, whose family and goodbrother basked in the ineptitude of a toothless lion. Castamere grew at the expense of The Rock, and it was glorious. When the cubs came biting in their father’s stead, why would Roger have paid them anymore heed? He’d already proven his claws sharper than any golden lion. This hubris would lead to destruction of both family and home, for this cub was none other than the future Lord Tywin Lannister. In a campaign that encapsulated the man he would come to be, Tywin reclaimed the debts his father’s vassals owed, bringing ruin and death to those who resisted. To Tarbeck and Reyne. By the time the Lannister armies reached Castamere, the Tarbecks had been extinguished, and Lord Roger was delirious with a wound he’d taken from a crossbow. His brother Reynard would shelter all their ilk below ground where Lannister soldiers, and call for negotiations, but their fate had already been foreshadowed both by the Tarbecks and by what Castamere was named for. Tywin would have all entrances to the Reyne’s mines sealed, and a nearby stream redirected to flow within. No defenses would keep out a flowing tide. Lannister guards are said to have heard panic and screaming through the night, but that would be the last whimper of defiance from house Reyne.\n\nSuch is how the once great Castamere has remained since, a watery tomb for a once great family. Until someone dares to dig out this grave..."
 ruin_history_hellgate:0 "Once the seat of House Dryland, Hellgate Hall now lies in ruin.

 ruin_history_woodfoot:0 "When Theon Stark first drove the Ironmen from Bear Island he bestowed the lands to House Woodfoot. The Woodfoots would protect the Island from all threats for nearly fifteen hundred years. It was only under Loron Greyjoy that the Ironmen would end House Woodfoot and take Bear Island once again. And, yet even after their end, the ruins of Woodfoot Watch, their ancient castle, remains."
 ruin_history_skane:0 "The Feast of Skane; Who in the North and beyond does not know of the Skagosi and their infamous Feast of Skane? When the Skags still had their ships, they reached out to nearby Skane, and it was there that they captured all the people of that island. The lucky ones were made thrall or wife, the unlucky were served as the meal at a great feast for the Skag raiders. The Feast was complete and Skane lies empty to this day."
 ruin_history_oldstones:0 "The list of River Kings is one hotly debated, both by Maesters and by the lords and ladies of the Riverlands. But, the first major house to be known as Kings of Rivers and Hills that all agree upon is House Mudd, the last of the First Men to have that title. It was from the castle today known as Oldstones that the Mudd Kings ruled, and for the later part of their reign battled the Andal Invaders. The castle was destroyed after the defeat of Tristifer IV and the end of the Mudd Kingdom."
 ruin_history_summerhall:0 "When King Daeron II brought Dorne into the realm, he showed his belief in peace by building a summer palace among the Marches, the famed Summerhall. This would serve as a regular retreat for the court to escape the smells of King's Landing during the Summer Moons, and would eventually be given to his youngest son, the future Maekar I. Maekar kept the seat as his own throughout the reigns of his brothers and his own rule, and finally upon his death that it would pass to it final holder, King Aegon V the Unlikely. It would be under the beloved King Aegon that Summerhall would come to knows its great tragedy for when the King summoned his family in the hopes of hatching dragons to the world once again, the castle and most of the royal family would end in fire. To this day Summerhall lies empty and ruined, with only the songs to keep it alive."
 ruin_history_morne:0 "The once royal seat of Tarth, it was here the Evenstars of House Tarth ruled as Kings of the Sapphire Isle, when the andal house first took the island. As time passed, and the Tarths married into both House Durrandon and their kingdom, the seat fell from significance, to the point where only ruins remain."

 ruin_history_generic:0 "The world itself is dotted with ruins, from Westeros to Essos, from Sothoryos to Ulthos; they spread across every land and every climate with little to no regard. Some were once great fortresses and castles, standing against enemies for thousands of years, only to be laid down to an unbeatable foe, others were watchtowers and small holdfasts that were broken by minor raids lost to time. Some are ancient beyond all reckoning, having been laid to ruin before the earliest records in the Citadel or Yi Ti, such as Yeen in Sothoryos, or Strygai in the Shadow. Others’ falls have been more recent and documented by the scholars of both the Sunset and Sunrise lands. Many have had legends, stories, or songs addressing them, or their last stand, and more lie forgotten and shunned by all singers.\n\nTo claim a destroyed county and begin reconstruction, go to the holding view and choose \"Restore Ruins\". When you own a ruins barony, you can upgrade the main ruins building to start restoration."

 agot_ruins.1000.d:0 "Rubble after rubble, brick after brick, before you stands that which had been left to crumble into obscurity and dust, now completely revitalized. With the help of Maesters and masons, the ruins have been rebuilt as similar to its original design as possible. However, a question remains unanswered. What purpose will it serve? Strong, unyielding walls may see that it becomes a castle which strength is a force to be reckoned with, the construction of nearby homes and markets could cause a bustling town to sprawl out from the keep as the heart of it, or the remodelling of the interior and its walls into a holier, more religious space should prove it to be a respectable place of worship. You analyze the options, and decide that you should plan ahead for..."

 agot_ruins.2000.d:0 "The tragedy at Summerhall has held a shadow over this project from the beginning. The more superstitious workers have whispered that the place is cursed and that the ghosts of the Targaryens who fell that day still haunt the very stones. Even the more cynical men seemed on edge when a tool was misplaced or a minor accident occurred.\n\nToday, however, rather than a curse, I have found a blessing. So close to the final stages of the restoration, a hidden chamber was discovered beneath the ruins! I have been brought before the chamber, and as I step inside, I can't help but whoop with joy. At the center of the room sits a small table with a pillow on it, and on that pillow, rests a pristine, unblemished dragon egg!"
