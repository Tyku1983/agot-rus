With much ceremony, the Magisters and the Gonfaloniere swear their allegiance to the new First Magister, and [magister_winner.GetHerHis] authority is officially acknowledged by the people. How [magister_winner.GetFullNameNoTooltip] will rule remains uncertain, and already the Magisters plot on how to sway their new leader to their side."

A memory of those days, when our cities were united and strong has been brought to our hearts once more.\n\n[request_sender.GetSheHe|U] once again wishes to raise the banner of the Kingdom of the Three Daughters, uniting Myr, Lys, and Tyrosh in purpose and power.\n\nWill we, as proud and sovereign cities, reject the animosity of the past and reform an eternal alliance from the days long gone? Will we stand together, shoulder to shoulder, and face the coming storms as a united Triarchy — or will we choose to follow our destiny as individual ships, facing the storms alone?"

Yet one day, the idea may rise again from the ashes.\n\nThe dream of a united realm, where Myr, Lys, and Tyrosh stand shoulder to shoulder, reclaiming their rightful lands, and repelling their foes back, remains distant. For now, those three cities stand apart, each pursuing its own path.\n\nIf only had the stars aligned differently, the known world would bend from our strength..."
