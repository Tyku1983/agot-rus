 agot_filler_riverlands.100.t:0 "The Flow of Trade"
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.desc:0 "While rivers can be like highways if you happen to be travelling downstream, they can also be barriers — impediments for those needing to cross; but opportunities for lords who hold the crossings. Lords like me.\n\nMy guards bring word of a merchant at my gates desirous of a swift crossing for his wagons and pack animals. No one but me can grant him what he seeks. How can I turn this to my advantage?"
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.a:0 "Anyone with wagons full of trade goods must also have much coin. Let’s see how much I can take."
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.a_tt:0 "You charge a nominal toll, but will extort him for more once he is within your walls."
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.b:0 "He is no merchant, but a spy sent by my enemies. I know just how to handle this…"
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.b_tt:0 "You kidnap him and send him to the dungeons to be tortured… or worse."
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.c:0 "Trade must flow. I am due but a modest fee."
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.c_tt:0 "You charge a nominal toll."
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.d:0 "Why should he be in such a rush? Let us feast and be merry!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.100.d_tt:0 "You invite the merchant to a feast"
 agot_filler_riverlands.101.t:0 "The Flow of Trade"
 agot_filler_riverlands.101.desc:0 "The nice thing about having a fortress athwart a river is that once a traveller begins the crossing, one can simply close the gates on each side, and it becomes rather difficult for the traveller to continue on or turn around. Of course, the merchant is less than pleased when I inform him that the toll has increased considerably, but what will he do; Say no?"
 agot_filler_riverlands.101.a:0 "I am altering the deal. Pray I do not alter it any further."
 agot_filler_riverlands.101.a_tt:0 "You extort the merchant."
 agot_filler_riverlands.102.t:0 "The Flow of Trade"
 agot_filler_riverlands.102.desc:0 "In the cold, damp depths of my dungeon, this so-called merchant isn’t half so arrogant. He begs for mercy, protesting his innocence, but to spare him would be to invite further intrusions.\n\nBesides, I think I’m going to enjoy what comes next."
 agot_filler_riverlands.102.a:0 "His agony is my delight, and I have so many tools with which to extract it."
 agot_filler_riverlands.102.b:0 "His flesh looks delectable."
 agot_filler_riverlands.102.a_tt:0 "You torture him."
 agot_filler_riverlands.102.b_tt:0 "You kill and eat him."
 agot_filler_riverlands.103.t:0 "The Flow of Trade"
 agot_filler_riverlands.103.desc:0 "Other lords might have taken a more predatory disposition, but my generosity has not gone unnoticed. The merchant spreads the word of my fundamental decency. It may not be fame or coin, but such a reputation is also a fine thing."
 agot_filler_riverlands.103.a:0 "Decency is its own reward."
 agot_filler_riverlands.103.a_tt:0 "You are content with your choice.."
 agot_filler_riverlands.104.t:0 "The Flow of Trade"
 agot_filler_riverlands.104.desc:0 "I’ve entertained lords and ladies in my halls often enough, but it isn’t every day I extend the privilege to a simple merchant. To my surprise and delight, the man is as pleasant as he is generous, offering up fine foodstuffs and spices for my kitchens to enhance the feast. The evening is one of laughter and good spirits and blessedly little pretence."
 agot_filler_riverlands.104.a:0 "Perhaps I should carouse with the smallfolk more often!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.104.b:0 "There is a glimmer in his eye. Perhaps we can continue this in a more intimate capacity."
 agot_filler_riverlands.104.a_tt:0 "You are enlivened by the party."
 agot_filler_riverlands.104.b_tt:0 "You invite him to your private quarters"
 agot_filler_riverlands.105.t:0 "The Flow of Trade"
 agot_filler_riverlands.105.desc:0 "In the privacy of my quarters, the glimmer in his eye becomes a burning flame. My pulse quickens at his touch, but his smile is easy."
 agot_filler_riverlands.105.a:0 "This feels right."
 agot_filler_riverlands.105.a_tt:0 "You enjoy a blissful evening with the merchant"
 agot_filler_riverlands.200.t:0 "Oldstone Rains"
 agot_filler_riverlands.200.desc:0 "Travelling between Fairmarket and Seagard with a small entourage, I notice a faint, earthy smell in the air. I look up just in time to catch the first drops of a downpour on my face. The only shelter from the cold and damp lies among the stones of a ruined fortress. The roads will be muddy and miserable until the rains stop, so I decide to rest among the ruins.\n\nIt is only after we set up camp that I realise that this is Oldstones, the ruined seat of House Mudd, ancient Kings of the Rivers and the Hills."
 agot_filler_riverlands.200.a:0 "This is a disquieting place to rest."
 agot_filler_riverlands.200.a_tt:0 "You are disturbed by the eerie ruins"
 agot_filler_riverlands.200.b:0 "There is so much history in this place. I am inspired to sing."
 agot_filler_riverlands.200.b_tt:0 "Choose one of several songs to sing"
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.t:0 "Oldstone Rains"
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.desc:0 "Tapping out a rhythm with my foot, I hum the prelude to an ancient tune before launching into the verse."
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.a:0 "#italic Star-eyed Ser Symeon, a warrior without peer…#!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.a_tt:0 "You sing of a legendary warrior with sapphires for eyes"

 agot_filler_riverlands.201.b_tt:0 "You sing of the trickster founder of House Lannister"
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.c:0 "#italic They say when Garth Greenhand did wander the land…#!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.c_tt:0 "You sing of Garth Greenhand, legendary grandsire of many great houses."
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.d:0 "#italic Fearless was he, the Knight Without Armor…#!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.201.d_tt:0 "You sing of a legendary warrior from the time of the Gardener Kings"
 agot_filler_riverlands.300.t:0 "Fishing Tournaments on the Trident"
 agot_filler_riverlands.300.desc:0 "While out riding my favorite palfrey on a particularly bright morning, I happen across a mismatched group of men jaunting excitedly down a path. Some are young, some old; some wear little more than rags, others the finer silks more typical of a successful merchant. All of them, however, carry fishing rods and tackle.\n\nI inquire as to the nature of their outing.\n\n\"We’re off to the Trident,\" one man replies, as if that explained all.\n\n\"Fishing,\" said another.\"The tournaments’ll be startin’ up soon. Begging your pardon, but you must’ve heard, milord.\""
 agot_filler_riverlands.300.a:0 "Someone will be making money on these tournaments. As lord, I am entitled to a certain proportion."
 agot_filler_riverlands.300.a_tt:0 "You levy a tax on the tournaments."
 agot_filler_riverlands.300.b:0 "I’m a fair hand at angling. Why shouldn’t I participate myself?"
 agot_filler_riverlands.300.b_tt:0 "You enter the tournaments"
 agot_filler_riverlands.301.t:0 "Fishing Tournaments on the Trident"
 agot_filler_riverlands.301.desc:0 "It is a pleasure to cast a line into the Trident, to find the slower water where the big fish waits for his dinner to be delivered, to conceal the line from his watchful eyes and to convince him that my knot of fibre is a true fly. It is a pleasure, but more than that, it is an art, and art does not come easy.\n\nI return home having convinced many big fish and having acquainted many fine anglers. It is remarkable how readily the barriers of station fall away amidst the early morning dimness that all fishers know and love. One fisherman I met — the son of a Septon — remarked that there is no clear line between religion and fishing in his family. What a thought!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.301.a:0 "The rivers are for fishing."
 agot_filler_riverlands.301.a_tt:0 "You return home reinvigorated."
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.t:0 "Grapes into Wine"
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.desc:0 "Riding along the Trident one day, I notice hills lined with neat rows of leafy vines.\n\n\"Surely not grapes,\" I remark, for everyone knows Dorne and the Arbor control the wine trade in Westeros.\n\n\"Not so,\" one of my companions explains. Apparently, there has been a recent blossoming of vineyards in the Riverlands.\n\nUpon reflection, it makes sense. Our soils are among the richest in Westeros, our lands the most fertile. Why should the water of the mighty Trident be any less succour to the grape than the sickly trickle of Dorne’s Greenblood?"
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.a:0 "There is potential in this. I shall start my own vineyard."
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.a_tt:0 "You will have to wait and see if your investment pays off."
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.b:0 "As a lord, I am entitled to a vineyard of my own."
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.b_tt:0 "You will forcibly appropriate a vineyard."
 agot_filler_riverlands.400.c:0 "We cannot afford this."
 agot_filler_riverlands.401.t:0 "Grapes into Wine"
 agot_filler_riverlands.401.desc:0 "My vines bask in the warm sun and are nourished by the loamy riverlands soils. The grapes grow fat on the vine and my vintners assure me that the harvest will be rich. This has been a splendid idea. It will not be long before I can sip a wine of my own making!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.401.a:0 "Everything is going swimmingly."
 agot_filler_riverlands.401.a_tt:0 "The vineyard will continue operating as normal."
 agot_filler_riverlands.401.b:0 "This is a better opportunity than I thought. I should invest more!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.401.b_tt:0 "With a larger initial outlay, you may turn greater profit in the long run."
 agot_filler_riverlands.402.t:0 "Grapes into Wine"
 agot_filler_riverlands.402.desc:0 "I recline on a cushioned chair on the balcony of my villa, sipping a glass of my own Riverlands White as I gaze across the rolling hills of my vineyard. The most promising barrels have been set aside for aging, but even the lesser casks have produced a fine product. Nor am I alone in this assessment, as evidenced by how easily we have been able to sell our early batches. The taste of the dry white on my tongue is as rich as the new inflows into my coffers."
 agot_filler_riverlands.402.a:0 "I’m a vintner now!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.402.a_tt:0 "You reap the profit of your investment."
 agot_filler_riverlands.500.t:0 "Iron Raiders"
 agot_filler_riverlands.500.desc:0 "The sun rises over a gray sky and cold sea winds that are almost familiar enough to be a comfort, but when the bronze bell of Seagard’s Booming Tower rings out over my lands, dread washes over me. It seems the winds have blown in not just clouds, but Ironborn raiders. Tales of slaughter and pillaging flash through my mind — the nightmare of every lord whose land lies along Ironman Bay."
 agot_filler_riverlands.500.a:0 "Today will test my mettle."
 agot_filler_riverlands.500.a_tt:0 "You must decide how to react"
 agot_filler_riverlands.501.t:0 "Iron Raiders"
 agot_filler_riverlands.501.desc:0 "I do not have the luxury of panic. While the smallfolk rush behind my walls, I gather my household guard and lead a sortie to challenge the raiders even as they swarm out of their longships. If I do not end this quickly, countless of my people will be killed.\n\nI spot the leader of the raiders, a vicious reaver who looks every bit the killer the Iron Islanders are reputed to be. He meets my gaze and his lips curl into a blood-crazed grin."
 agot_filler_riverlands.501.a:0 "These scum will remember it was [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName] who threw them back into the sea."
 agot_filler_riverlands.501.a_tt:0 "You challenge the leader to a duel"
 agot_filler_riverlands.501.b:0 "I cannot face him. There is no choice but to run!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.501.b_tt:0 "You will survive, but your lands will be pillaged."
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.t:0 "Iron Raiders"
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.desc:0 "The blood of my slain foe mingles with seawater at my feet. For a moment, the Ironborn raiders seem to consider continuing their raid despite the terms of the duel, but I have bought enough time that most items of value will be hidden and most of the smallfolk safely behind stout walls.\n\nWith more of my men rallying to the defense every minute, the Ironborn realize their attack has been thwarted, and they return to their longships and the sea."
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.a:0 "They will not soon be back."
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.a_tt:0 "The raiders flee."
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.b:0 "They might return at any time."
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.b_tt:0 "You will tighten security along the coast."
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.c:0 "This victory calls for a celebration!"
 agot_filler_riverlands.502.c_tt:0 "You host a feast honoring all who took part in the defense."
 agot_filler_riverlands.600:0 "The Butter Lords"
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.t:0 "[PLACEHOLDER] Cattle Stealer"
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.desc:0 "[PLACEHOLDER] An angry Lord blames you for stealing his cattle"
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.a:0 "[PLACEHOLDER] Give the Cattle back"
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.a_tt:0 "You give the cattle back to the lord."
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.b:0 "Deny everything"
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.b_tt:0 "The Lord will be angered with you"
 agot_filler_riverlands.600.c:0 "Ignore it, it will blow away like the wind."

 agot_filler_riverlands.0001.t:0 "The Forgotten Past"
 agot_filler_riverlands.0001.desc:0 "The verdant countryside of the riverlands is, to my mind, unmatched in all of Westeros for the solitude it affords the lone wanderer. On occasion, however, that solitude can be crowded out by ghosts from the past, for the riverlands are dense with the history of both the First Men and the Andals.\n\nWandering a long forgotten trail, I pass through a dense thicket of yew and ferns and emerge into a clearing. The air is heavy and cold, the noises of the forest gone, as if banished by some ancient decree. Before me stands a ruined shrine, its stone structure long since ruptured and worn by vine and root. Still, I can make out the vaguely human form the ancient artisans sought to depict, faded runes encircling its body. A god, plainly — its eyes still possessed of the intensity of the divine, even after so many centuries of neglect."
 agot_filler_riverlands.0001.a:0 "So much effort in the service of false gods — we are more enlightened now."
 agot_filler_riverlands.0001.b:0 "The beauty of this place cannot be denied. I appreciate it for what it is."
