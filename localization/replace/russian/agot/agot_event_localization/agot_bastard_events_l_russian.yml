I don't notice myself standing, only realising I am descening from the throne when I am halfway down it.\n\nWithout waiting for the judgement to finish, I take one of the Kingsguard's swords from their sheaths as I pass, and with a swing and a yell, I cleave the bastard's head clean from [reveal_scope.GetHerHis] body, the swordpoint cracking the stonework beneath.

I look down at [reveal_scope.GetFirstNamePossessive] lifeless eyes, and I find no peace. The rage has not abated. Lyanna is still not here. The look in my courtiers eyes are the same I saw in the Mad Kings court, and I wonder how it came to this."
