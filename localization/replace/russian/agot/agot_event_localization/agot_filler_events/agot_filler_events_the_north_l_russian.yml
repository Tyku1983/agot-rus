 agot_filler_north.0033.desc:0 "Traveling through some of the more remote parts of my domain can be very rewarding. I find that taking long walks through the woods, or the hills, or even just a field, can deeply relieve the stresses of being a noble.\n\nToday, I am wandering through a small, forgotten forest. The trees are very old, their thick trunks intersect and intermingle with one another in ways I've never seen before. As I trek further into the woods, I spot a beautiful white and red tree - a weirwood! These ancient trees are all still alive here in the North, but to see one in the deep wilderness like this is... humbling. I walk up to the trunk and look into the weeping face that the Children of the Forest had carved thousands of years of ago. I take in its strange beauty and can't help but feel relaxed as I turn to leave."
 agot_filler_north.0033.a:0 "Such a beautiful tree."

 agot_filler_north.0034.desc:0 "It's another long night in my study. The sun has set, and the moon has climbed high into the sky. I hardly need my candle with the moon shining so bright. As I'm spending hours reviewing reports, reading accounts, and stamping documents, I come across a recent report signed by both my steward and marshall.\n\nThe report notes that shearers across my demesne have found a growing number of dying or injured woolers — animals that produce wool, as noted by my steward in the report. Goats, sheep, and even wooldogs have been viciously attacked in the night by what many claim to be large, ravenous wolf packs. Should these attacks continue in their current number, the wool trade could face serious drawbacks.\n\nComing up with a solution to this problem seems suddenly prudent; it would be nice to present a resolution to my council tommorow morning."
 agot_filler_north.0034.a:0 "Post a bounty for wolves, and pay every hunter in gold for each wolf slain."
 agot_filler_north.0034.b:0 "Issue a citation to the shearers for not taking care of their woolers."

They've mulched the flowerbeds, planted new flowers, trimmed the hedges, and have generally improved the Godswood, making it reminiciest of a small grove.\n\nBut the gardening staff have come to me with a request to spruce up the weirwood heart tree that stands proud over the entire Godswood. The gardeners tell me that they'll only beautify it, pruning the branches and roots, but I'm wary of any potential damages to it. After all, what kind of Northerner lets his heart tree fall into ruin?"
 agot_filler_north.0035.a:0 "Let only the most experienced gardeners handle it."
 agot_filler_north.0035.b:0 "What can go wrong?"
 agot_filler_north.0035.c:0 "I don't want to risk it... The heart tree is too sacred."

I've taken a few hours to myself to walk around some of the smaller settlements near my keep, taking in nature and simply enjoying the nice day.\n\nAs I'm walking, I come upon a frozen pond and see some smallfolk wonderously skating around on the ice! Their movements are all over the place; many fall onto the ice, but some are gliding beautifully. Ah, what a pretty sight!"

It is a shaggy and powerful beast that has replaced the horse in this part of the world. On its head is a single long horn that is highly valued by traders across the known world. The Skagosi ride this beast into battle whenever conflict calls, and together Skagosi and beast feast on the flesh of their slain foes.\n\nThis beast is none other than the #bold unicorn#!. A ferocious beast capable of holding its own against the likes of even direwolves, the unicorn is no beast to tempt. And this is why the Skagosi have domesticated them."

But it seems that even the colder climate has not deterred some smallfolk from trying their luck with ice fishing. It looks like they've punctured some holes to reach the water beneath the thick ice...\n\nI walk closer and take a look at their catches and equipment. They quickly notice me and immediately strike up a conversation about how well stocked the ponds are and how good the fishing is.

Spending a week in the woods completely away from court and from ruling—and from the small issues in life — is something most in my position can only dream of. But in the North, this is our tradition. Our heritage.\n\nThe moon is high over our heads, and our host, a man named Beron, looks up from the fire with a ghastly scowl.\n\n"My friends," he says, the fire dancing in the black of his eyes, "they say there is a legend about these woods. A frightening and old legend. Do you all know it?" The men grunt their collective no's and prompt him to share it.\n\n"Long ago, hunters and foragers avoided these woods as if it were filled with dragons. The lord of these woods was puzzled; it had good game to hunt and nice berries to forage. So, he ventured into the woods to find out why it was like poison to his folk."\n\n"In these woods, he searched many days and nights for any signs. But he came up with nothing at every turn. Until one night, just like this one, when the moon was high in the sky, he felt an icy and ominous wind. Suddenly, from behind him, he saw none other than an #italic Other#!, come to kill him-"\n\nOut of nowhere, you and your companions here some rustling from the bushes... Beron gasps as someone jumps out from the bushes, screaming wildly at you all! You can hear Beron laughing wildly over the man's screaming!"
